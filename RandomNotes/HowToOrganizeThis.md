# Organization ideas

 - Where should I write the objectives of this project? Surely in the README.md should use to write how to use the develeped software, but I need something to write the developement ideas with clear objectives or questions.
 - How should organize the papers management, meaning I would like to share my reference bibtex in order to sync it with the very different tools like javref, zotero, mendeley and research rabbit.
