# Random ideas
Here I'll add some comments about what I want to do

## What are my research questions?
- Is the gut microbiota a stable system? or it's constantly unstable so that's why migration (by food for instance) is fundamental?
- If the system is stable using a lotka-volterra system of equations really a good approximation?
- It is possible to infer it from samples? Or it is something complicated
- I would like to see if the distributions of bacteria could be in a way divided in subsystem, like the bacterias in surface of the gut and others in the bulk.
- What papers are aligned with my research questions?
- Which scientific community is aligned with my questions, I'm looking for something more applied like what clinitians are looking for or should I focus in a more theoretical description?
- What would be the Fokker-Planck approach to this or maybe with in some master equation perhaps?

## How to organize the project?

- Where should I write the objectives of this project? Surely in the README.md should use to write how to use the develeped software, but I need something to write the developement ideas with clear objectives or questions.
- How should organize the papers management, meaning I would like to share my reference bibtex in order to sync it with the very different tools like jabref, zotero, mendeley and research rabbit.

## How to establish the objectives

## Research Proposal

Here are the guidelines to write my research proposal:

1. Title Page

    Title: Make it descriptive, clear, and to the point.
    Your name: List the primary investigator(s) or research team.
    Institution/affiliation: Include your department or program.
    Date of submission.

2. Abstract

    A brief summary (150-250 words) that highlights your research question, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes.
    Keep it concise yet informative, giving readers a quick overview of your proposed study.

3. Introduction

    Background: Explain the general context of your study, setting the stage for your research question.
    Research Problem: Clearly state the issue you intend to address. Include relevant statistics or data if it strengthens the case.
    Purpose and Objectives: Outline what you aim to achieve with this research.
    Research Questions and Hypotheses: List your primary research question(s) and hypotheses, if applicable. Make sure these are specific, measurable, and feasible.
    Significance of the Study: Describe why your research is important. Explain its potential impact on the field, society, or specific stakeholders.

4. Literature Review

    Summarize the current state of knowledge on your topic, highlighting key theories, findings, and gaps in the literature.
    Demonstrate how your research builds on or differs from existing studies.
    Emphasize why your study is necessary in light of the reviewed literature, filling gaps or expanding on limitations.

5. Research Design and Methodology

    Research Approach: Explain if you’re using a qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods approach, and why it’s appropriate.
    Data Collection Methods: Describe how you will collect data (e.g., surveys, interviews, experiments), specifying any tools, instruments, or software you plan to use.
    Sampling and Participants: Identify your sample population, sampling technique, and inclusion/exclusion criteria.
    Data Analysis: Outline how you plan to analyze the data (e.g., statistical methods, coding for qualitative data).
    Timeline: Provide a realistic timeline for completing each phase of your research, from data collection to analysis.
    Ethical Considerations: Address any ethical concerns (e.g., consent, confidentiality) and explain how you will manage them.

6. Expected Results

    Briefly state the anticipated outcomes or contributions of your study, even if they’re speculative.
    Explain how the results will address the research problem and fulfill the study’s objectives.

7. Limitations

    Acknowledge any limitations that may affect your study, such as sample size, potential biases, or measurement constraints.
    Propose ways you plan to address or minimize these limitations.

8. Budget (if applicable)

    List anticipated expenses, including costs for materials, data collection, software, travel, and personnel.
    Provide justifications for each budget item, and keep it as transparent as possible.

9. References

    Include a properly formatted bibliography of the sources cited in your proposal.
    Follow the referencing style required by your institution or discipline (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago).
