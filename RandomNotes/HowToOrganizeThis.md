# Random ideas
Here I'll add some comments about what I want to do

## What are my research questions?
- Is the gut microbiota a stable system? or it's constantly unstable so that's why migration (by food for instance) is fundamental?
- If the system is stable using a lotka-volterra system of equations really a good approximation?
- It is possible to infer it from samples? Or it is something complicated
- I would like to see if the distributions of bacteria could be in a way divided in subsystem, like the bacterias in surface of the gut and others in the bulk.
- What papers are aligned with my research questions?
- Which scientific community is aligned with my questions, I'm looking for something more applied like what clinitians are looking for or should I focus in a more theoretical description?
- What would be the Fokker-Planck approach to this or maybe with in some master equation perhaps?

## How to organize the project?

- Where should I write the objectives of this project? Surely in the README.md should use to write how to use the develeped software, but I need something to write the developement ideas with clear objectives or questions.
- How should organize the papers management, meaning I would like to share my reference bibtex in order to sync it with the very different tools like jabref, zotero, mendeley and research rabbit.

## How to stablish the objectives
