Today I want to set how I organize the project flow, to do tha I created this log entry and deciding which tool I'll use to journaling the hole process. I'll edit this markdown files using zettlr.

Now I also would like to set the objectives of the project, I need to write down my thoughts.
My questions are basically this:

**How can we predict the dynamic evolution of bacteria that follows a lotka-volterra system?**

Now I have one program to simulate the dynamics of a lotka-volterra system.
So I think that one of the first things to do is check in the literature what other inferred systems of gut microbiota are out there
So add on research rabbit the paper of
