Today I want to set how I organize the project flow, to do tha I created this log entry and deciding which tool I'll use to journaling the hole process. I'll edit this markdown files using zettlr.

Now I also would like to set the objectives of the project, I need to write down my thoughts.
My questions are basically this:

**How can we predict the dynamic evolution of bacteria that follows a lotka-volterra system?**
