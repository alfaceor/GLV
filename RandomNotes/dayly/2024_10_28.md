Now I have a new program with the correct interactions considering Jinju's coefficients.

Something that I found interesting is that in Jinju's system some of the species have a negative growth rate, meaning that those families depend on the commuity interactions to survive

Also I notice that the community matrix is not what I thought it was, need to recheck that details and take another look to the grilli, allesina paper allesina2015stability.

So I need to write a clear definition of the community matrix and what we know about the stability of the system based on this.
