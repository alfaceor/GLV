# TODO list

 - [ ] Aparently the unities in Jinju's model are quite peculiar the abundance is in the order to log10(CFU/g) and the mu{kprime,k} are in 10^(-9) log10(CFU/g/day). So that is a source of error on the stability.
 - [ ] I need to renormalize the parameters in Jinju's estimation to avoid numerical errors
 - [ ] Write Methods in paper
 - [ ] How can I make something similar to a Mori projection for the effect of the other species?
